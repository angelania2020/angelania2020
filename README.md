- 👋 Hello, I am a junior software developer living in Estonia.
- 👩‍💻 I became interested in programming in the 00s when I started creating my websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 👍 I am a hard-working person and a quick learner. I truly enjoy the process of programming. I can communicate with clients in English, Estonian and Russian languages.
- 🌱 My current main goal is to learn JavaScript, React, Data structures and Algorithms.
- 💞️ I am looking forward to joining a friendly team of other developers and creating awesome UX/UI websites for organizations.
- 📁 My portfolio can be found [here](http://angelina.rf.gd/).
